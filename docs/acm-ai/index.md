> **Status:** Planning Phase
> **Last Updated:** 2025-12-07

## Overview

This project transforms Open Notebook into **ACM-AI** - an intelligent document processing platform specialized for Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) management and compliance.

## Documentation Structure

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [System Analysis](./01-system-analysis.md) | Current architecture and capabilities | Complete |
| [Product Brief](./02-product-brief.md) | High-level product vision and goals | Complete |
| [PRD](./03-prd.md) | Detailed requirements document | Complete |
| [Architecture](./04-architecture.md) | Technical architecture decisions | Complete |
| [Epics & Stories](./05-epics-and-stories.md) | Implementation breakdown | Complete |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Relationship to Open Notebook | Feature integration + rebrand | Leverage existing infrastructure |
| Spreadsheet Library | AG Grid | Enterprise-grade, feature-rich |
| Chat-Spreadsheet Interaction | Read-only (query/cite) | Compliance data integrity |
